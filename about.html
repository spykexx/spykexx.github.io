            We are a Direct Primary Care (DPC) clinic serving the Quad Cities
            area. Our patients pay a flat monthly rate and we do not bill
            insurance. The care our patients receive is the highest quality and
            is personalized to their needs (we provide the highest quality
            primary care available). The monthly fee is more affordable than
            insurance premiums, deductibles and co-pays. By taking insurance and
            politics out of healthcare, you and your family will get the care
            you deserve, when you deserve it.

            For a long time, we have feared affordable, accessible, personalized
            healthcare for our patients would be too difficult to continue and
            provide. At Essential Health, we are changing the approach of
            healthcare to ensure our patients are the top priority. We want to
            assure our patients they will be personally cared for, listened to
            and respected now and in the future. In a time of unforeseen events,
            your healthcare will be steady and dependable, exactly what you
            deserve.
